- Instructor: 許元春
- Textbook: [A first course in stochastic calculus by Louis-Pierre Arguin, American Mathematical Society, 2022]

## Updates on Numerical Assignments
Here, I'll be updating my practice numerical assignments from the textbook. Occasionally, I'll supplement with content previously covered in the statistics course - "Statistical Learning" using Ross's simulation.
You can visit my hackmd to see  the detail https://hackmd.io/4m94zjAmQYSZ6dupjdsNRw

## Contente
**You can find all the code in the code folder, and you can locate the .md files in the markdown folder. However, it's recommended to view them on HackMD.**
